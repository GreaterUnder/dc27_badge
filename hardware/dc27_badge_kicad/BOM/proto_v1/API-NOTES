get bom:

/api/v3/pcb/{pcb_id}/{pcb_version}/bom

email address in the top right corner when logged in, and then clicking on "Settings"

In each request, you must provide your apikey as a URL parameter with the name 'apikey', e.g.:

https://api.macrofab.com/api/v2/{endpoint}?apikey=abcedefgh


Response Types
By default, you should request a response type of 'application/json'. However, if you are doing quick testing using cUrl, or the like, you may find that some endpoints return html or other formats when you do not specify the response type. You can override this behavior by providing the 'format=json' url parameter and value, e.g.:

curl -XGET "https://api.macrofab.com/api/v2/{endpoint}?apikey=abcdefgh&format=json"
