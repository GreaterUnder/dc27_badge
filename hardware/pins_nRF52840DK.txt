NRF52840 DK board pin connections

This is the I/O pinout for the Nordic nRF52840 DK (development kit board).
There is also a Rigado BMD-340 EVAL board which is basically the same,
except it has the BMD-340 module mounted while the Nordic board just has
a bare nRF52840 chip mounted. Functionally they are identical.

Notes:

- The nRF52840 has an extra bank of 16 GPIO pins, for a total of 48. These
  pins are accessed via a separate register block at offset 0x50000300. In
  ChibiOS these are referenced as IOPORT1 and IOPORT2. These are shown as two
  separate tables below.

- The connections shown below currently reflect only what's on the dev
  board. No extra peripherals have been configured yet.

- In order to allow peripherals to be able to select from all 48 pins for
  their I/O configuration, the pin select registers now have an extra field.
  The lowest 5 bits (0 to 4) select the pin number (0-31) and the 6th bit
  (bit 5) selects which port to use.

- Unlike the nRF52832 dev boards, the nRF52840 boards have a QSPI flash
  part connected to 6 pins (CS, clock and 4 I/O lines). The user guide
  document tays this is a 64MB part. However I've seen at least one document
  where it says it's only 4MB. When properly configured, the nRF52840 allows
  code to be executed from the QSPI flash device. It's not clear yet if
  simple loads/stores also work, i.e. the device is just simply memory-mapped,
  but if it is it may be desirable to use this for holding ancillary data
  like fonts so that they can be drawn quickly.
