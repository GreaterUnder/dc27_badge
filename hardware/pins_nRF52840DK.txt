NRF52840 DK board pin connections

This is the I/O pinout for the Nordic nRF52840 DK (development kit board).
There is also a Rigado BMD-340 EVAL board which is basically the same,
except it has the BMD-340 module mounted while the Nordic board just has
a bare nRF52840 chip mounted. Functionally they are identical.

Notes:

- Rigado and Nordic both have their own development boards. The Nordic
  one has the nRF52840 chip mounted directly on it. The Rigado board
  has the Rigado BMD-340 module on it instead. But both use the same
  headers and peripherals, so from a software perspective they should
  be identical.

- The nRF52840 has an extra bank of 16 GPIO pins, for a total of 48. These
  pins are accessed via a separate register block at offset 0x50000300. In
  ChibiOS these are referenced as IOPORT1 and IOPORT2. These are shown as two
  separate tables below.

- The connections shown below currently reflect only what's on the dev
  board. No extra peripherals have been configured yet.

- In order to allow peripherals to be able to select from all 48 pins for
  their I/O configuration, the pin select registers now have an extra field.
  The lowest 5 bits (0 to 4) select the pin number (0-31) and the 6th bit
  (bit 5) selects which port to use.

- Unlike the nRF52832 dev boards, the nRF52840 boards have a QSPI flash
  part connected to 6 pins (CS, clock and 4 I/O lines). The user guide
  document tays this is a 64Mb part. This actually means 64 megabits.
  That translates to 8MB. When properly configured, the nRF52840 allows
  code to be executed from the QSPI flash device. The QSPI is can also be
  memory-mapped. however the Nordic chip only allows a limited amount of
  address space to be used for this purpose which restricts the mapped
  range to about 128MB. This does not preculude the use of QSPI parts
  larger than that, since read access can still be performed via the
  QSPI controller inteface -- it just means that only 128MB may be
  visible via the memory-mapped method.

- The NRF52 chip has two places where you can connect crystals:

  1) Two dedicated pins for a 32MHz crystal
  2) The pins for P0.00 and P0.01, which can be used with a 32.768KHz
     crystal

  The chip has both a high speed clock and low speed clock. The 32MHz
  crystal is always required for the high speed clock. This same clock
  is used for the ARM CPU core and bus clocks. The low speed clock
  has three possible sources:

  1) Internal RC oscillator
  2) External 32.768KHz crystal
  3) Synthesized from 32MHz clock

  For certain applications, like if you use the ANT stack, you are
  required to use a 32.768KHz crystal for the low speed clock. The Nordic
  and Rigado reference boards come with this crystal too. However for
  our application (just using plain BLE), we technically don't need
  this extra crystal: we can make do with just the 32MHz crystal for
  the high speed clock. Note that the Rigado BMD-340 has the 32MHz
  crystal inside the module while the Nordic reference design has
  it on the main board instead.
